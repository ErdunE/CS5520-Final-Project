He built the Garden View using Java Graphics, an interactive visualization where each habit is represented as a plant that grows through multiple stages as habits are completed. He implemented dynamic plant positioning and varied plant appearances with different growth stages. Additionally, he was heavily involved in the overall UI design of the application.
